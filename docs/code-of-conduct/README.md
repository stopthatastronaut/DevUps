### Code of Conduct for the DevUps Community




Welcome to DevUps!
--------

DevUps is a discord-based community that aims to foster and support mentoring relationships within the Tech space. We initially specialise around the DevOps/Cloud discipline area, but will touch on many parts of the Tech industry as we grow and evolve. Our community ranges from Industry Veterans and CTOs to relative beginners working towards their first tech role. We want to build a tolerant, friendly community in which everyone can grow, learn, and hopefully increase their value in the industry.

The current admins are:

* stopthatastronaut (Jason Brown)
* DamianM (Damian Maclennan)
* AndyMac4182 (Andrew Mac)



Respect
-------

Be respectful of each other. Pretty easy starting point. As with all online communication, be aware of context. There may well be onlookers or particpants who lack the context of a given conversation, so may go away with the wrong conclusion.

We provide a [#thunderdome](https://discord.com/channels/948035550802219078/948040126523654196), which is a good place for off-topic discussions, random links, venting your frustrations with a tricky bug or just letting off a little steam - but do remember that when all is said and done, DevUps is a space for professional development and you *should probably remain in professional mode*.

On Commercial Considerations
----------------------------

As this is a work-oriented space, DevUps members will inevitably end up discussing topics of a commercial nature. **Please, no sales pitches**. Yes, it is totally legitimate to recommend a product or vendor you've found helpful, even recommend your own product if it fits the bill - but DevUps is not a sales platform.

We are currently unsponsored and run by the community for the community. While we don't rule out future commercial relationships such as sponsorships, we the admins hereby commit that we will never put the hard sell on our members on behalf of a sponsor. That's not what we're here for.

Lastly, as noted under "Logs and Records", try not to share commercial-in-confidence information on DevUps, and respect software rights, licencing and contracts.

On Harrassment
--------------

We want this to be a fun, pleasant, productive and harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Finally, try not to belittle someone based on their perceived skill levels or experience, we are **all** here to grow and learn.

Logs and Records:
-----------------

**Please be mindful that things you say here may at some point become public**. We cannot prevent people from screencapping or otherwise logging this server. We also can't guarantee that every member's login credentials and logged-in devices are secure. Files uploaded here can be downloaded by anyone with a login. Please exercise caution and refrain from sharing sensitive information that could harm you or others if it became public.

Since we are an industry-focused community, please be mindful about sharing company information or IP, and be respectful of software licences and contract terms. There is definitely a place for sharing code snippets, or patterns and practices, but plase check that you're not sharing anything you shouldn't.

Harassment:
-----------

Harassment includes:

* Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion
* Unwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, and employment.
* Deliberate misgendering or use of ‘dead’ or rejected names
* Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behavior in spaces where they’re not appropriate
* Simulated physical contact (e.g. textual descriptions like “*hug*” or “*backrub*”) without consent or after a request to stop.
* Threats of violence
* Incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm
* Deliberate intimidation
* Sustained disruption of discussion
* Unwelcome sexual attention
* Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease
* Publication of non-harassing private communication

Reporting
---------

If you are subject to a breach of this code or see anyone else breaching this code, or have any other concerns, please contact the admins. They'll respond as promptly as they can.

We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we’ve received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them. We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.

Consequences
------------

Participants asked to stop any breaches of code are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in breaches of code, the admins may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from this server and identifying the participant publicly as someone about whom we've received complaints.
